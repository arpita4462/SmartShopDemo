    Privacy policy</h3>
<h4><p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify">Introduction</p></h4><p style="margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"> Welcome to Smart shop!</p>
<p style="margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify">As part of our mission to help make commerce better for everyone, Smart shop Inc. and its affiliates, including Smart shop Data Processing (IND) Inc., Smart shop Payments (IND) Inc., Smart shop (IND) Inc., and Smart shop International Limited (collectively, “Smart shop”) collect and process a lot of information. This Privacy Policy is intended to help you better understand how we collect, use and store your personal information—whether you are a merchant or end user that uses Smart shop’s products, applications or services (together, the “Services”), a customer that shops at a store using our technology, a customer that has opted into Smart shop Pay, a participant in Smart shop’s “Partners” program, or whether you’re simply visiting this website. By using any of Smart shop’s Services, or by dealing with a merchant using Smart shop’s Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the Smart shop Terms of Service.</p>
<p style="margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify">We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our privacy practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and where appropriate, by other means. By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.</p>

<h4><p style="font-size:15px;margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify">Information from merchants</p></h4><p style="margin:10px;line-height:22px;padding:0px 0px 15px;text-align:justify"> Privacy matters! If you are a merchant, your customers need to understand how you (and how Smart shop) collects and processes their personal information as the data controller. Accordingly, if you use the Services, you agree to post an up-to-date and accurate privacy policy on your storefront that complies with the laws applicable to your business. You also agree to obtain consent from your customers for the use and access of their personal information by Smart shop and other third parties. In addition, if you are collecting any sensitive personal information from your customers (including information relating to medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or sexuality), you agree to obtain affirmative, express consent from your customers for the use and access of sensitive personal information by Smart shop and other third parties. To help you get started on creating your own privacy policy, you can check out our privacy policy generator.</p>
